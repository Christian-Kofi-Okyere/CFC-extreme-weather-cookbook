    "Extreme weather events, both atmospheric and oceanic, are increasing in frequency and intensity as a consequence of anthropogenic warming. The processes responsible for such events and their impacts on Caribbean lives remain to be well understood. Our Caribbeans for Climate community (a community of Caribbean-identified climate scientists, oceanographers, and practitioners) have created a cookbook analyzing Caribbean atmospheric and oceanic extreme weather variability from 2000-present, using Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) data. In this notebook, we execute basic statistical analysis to investigate the linkages between extreme atmospheric and oceanic heat-related events and the possible causes behind them.\n",

Generally, they are defined as a MHW event when sea surface temperature (SST) exceed a certain threshold (typically, the 90th percentile threshold), and lasts for ≥5 consecutive days. These events can be devastating to marine life and the people that depend on maritime regions for sustenance and economy; such as fisheries and tribal communities. Despite their societal importance, however, a comprehensive understanding of the physical mechanisms driving MHWs in current and future climates does not yet exist. \n",
